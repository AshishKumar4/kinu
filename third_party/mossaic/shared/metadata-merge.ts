/**
 * deep-merge for metadata patches.
 *
 * Pure function. Models the `patchMetadata` semantics:
 *   - The patch is recursively merged with the existing metadata.
 *   - A leaf value of `null` in the patch DELETES that key from the
 *     merged result (tombstone semantics — the only way to remove
 *     a key without replacing the entire blob).
 *   - Arrays are REPLACED, not merged. Concat-merge has no
 *     well-defined semantics across nested keys.
 *   - Primitives in the patch overwrite primitives in the base.
 *   - Objects in the patch are merged recursively.
 *
 * The function is total — given any `base` and `patch` of valid
 * shape, it returns a new object without mutating either input.
 *
 * Modeled in lean/Mossaic/Vfs/Metadata.lean as `mergeMeta`.
