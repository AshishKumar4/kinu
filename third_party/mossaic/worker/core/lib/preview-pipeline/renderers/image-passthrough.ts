/**
 * Image-passthrough renderer.
 *
 * Returns the source bytes verbatim with their original MIME type
 * and the variant's nominal display dimensions. Used as the
 * `EMOSSAIC_UNAVAILABLE` fallback for `image/*` sources when the
 * Cloudflare Images binding is absent (test miniflare, service-mode
 * deployments without IMAGES). Strictly better than icon-card for
 * image MIMEs because the consumer at least gets a usable preview
 * — the browser scales it down on display.
 *
 * Non-image MIMEs (video, document, etc.) keep the icon-card
 * fallback because returning their original bytes (e.g. a 200 MB
 * MP4 in lieu of a 256-px thumbnail) would dwarf the Worker's
 * response budget and is never what the caller wanted from
 * "give me a thumbnail".
 *
 * Determinism: the bytes are content-addressed by the source file,
 * so passthrough's output hash is byte-identical for byte-identical
 * inputs. That keeps `file_variants.chunk_hash` content-deterministic
 * (the load-bearing property for variant dedup).
 *
 * Width/height are reported as the variant's nominal request
 * dimensions, NOT the actual decoded image size — we don't decode
 * here. Consumers that care about the true intrinsic dimensions
 * should ask the IMAGES binding once it's wired.
