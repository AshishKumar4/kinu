/**
 * Core-only Worker entry — used by the service-mode
 * deployment at `deployments/service/wrangler.jsonc`. Exports just
 * the two Durable Object classes (UserDOCore, ShardDO) and a
 * minimal Hono router that mounts only the VFS HTTP fallback
 * and a health check.
 *
 * The legacy photo-app routes (/api/auth, /api/upload, /api/files,
 * /api/folders, /api/gallery, /api/analytics, /api/search,
 * /api/shared, /api/download) live in `worker/app/index.ts` and are
 * NOT exposed here — service-mode is a pure SDK backend.
 *
 * SearchDO is App-only. It backs the photo-library's CLIP/BGE vector
 * search in `worker/app/routes/search.ts` and is not used by any
 * Core surface (UserDOCore + ShardDO never touch it). It lives at
 * `worker/app/objects/search/` and is bound only by the App-mode
 * production wrangler.
 *
 * SDK consumers who want a turn-key Mossaic backend on Cloudflare
 * either:
 *   (a) bind UserDOCore + ShardDO directly via
 *       `script_name: "mossaic-core"` in their own wrangler (Mode B
 *       in the SDK README), letting Cloudflare's edge route DO RPC
 *       across Workers; OR
 *   (b) re-export UserDO + ShardDO from `@mossaic/sdk` inside their
 *       own Worker (Mode A — library mode).
 *
 * Vector search is intentionally NOT part of either mode. Consumers
 * who need semantic search should run their own Vectorize index or
 * a separate Durable Object — Mossaic stays a pure VFS.
