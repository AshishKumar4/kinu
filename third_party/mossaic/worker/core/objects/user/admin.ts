/**
 * Admin tooling — operator-only helpers, not exposed via the public
 * VFS RPC surface or the legacy fetch routes.
 *
 * dedupePaths(userId): resolve legacy duplicate (parent_id, file_name)
 * rows that pre-date the UNIQUE partial index. The migration
 * tries to add the index lazily in ensureInit, but if existing data
 * has live duplicates the CREATE throws and is swallowed by
 * ensureInit's try/catch. This routine is the manual cleanup pass:
 *
 *   1. Identify groups of (user_id, IFNULL(parent_id,''), file_name)
 *      where >1 rows have status != 'deleted'.
 *   2. Within each group: keep the row with the largest updated_at
 *      (last writer wins; ties broken by file_id lexicographic, which
 *      is monotonic-ish since generateId is timestamp-prefixed).
 *   3. For each loser: hard-delete its files row + file_chunks rows and
 *      stage durable paged shard cleanup through the standard outbox.
 *   4. Attempt to (re-)create the UNIQUE partial index. Returns the
 *      number of rows reconciled and whether the index was created.
 *
 * Concurrency: the routine runs as one DO RPC method. DOs serialise
 * synchronous code, but each cleanup drain temporarily releases the input
 * lock, so a concurrent VFS write
 * CAN interleave with the dedupe pass. This is acceptable because:
 *   - In-flight writes use status='uploading' + a `_vfs_tmp_<id>`
 *     name; they never participate in an organic-name dupe group.
 *   - Newly-committed files have a fresher updated_at than anything
 *     dedupe is processing, so they would be the "winner" anyway.
 *   - The unique partial index, if successfully created at the end
 *     of the pass, then prevents future dupes.
 * If strict serialisation is required, wrap the call in
 * `this.ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile(...)` at the call site. Default
 * here is "eventually correct" — operator can re-run dedupePaths
 * if a race introduced a fresh dupe.
 *
 * Folders: the same shape applies. Different table, no soft-delete
 * column, but otherwise identical: pick newest, drop the rest, but
 * we ONLY drop a folder if it has no children (a folder with
 * children participating in the dupe is not safe to delete because
 * its file_id is referenced by file_chunks.file_id implicitly via
 * parent_id; we can't reparent without knowing intent). For the
 * MVP we report-but-skip duped folders that have children.
