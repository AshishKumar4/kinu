/**
 * Stream helpers used by the SDK's `VFS` class.
 *
 * The DO RPC surface returns native Web Streams (`ReadableStream` /
 * `WritableStream`) over the binding boundary. The SDK's only job is
 * to await the RPC method and surface the stream to the consumer, with
 * mapped errors.
 *
 * For `createWriteStream`, the DO RPC returns `{ stream, handle }` so
 * the consumer can grab the handle for resumable / progress use cases.
 * The SDK's default surface returns just the `WritableStream` (matches
 * the plan §5.2 signature); a separate `createWriteStreamWithHandle`
 * exposes the handle when needed.
