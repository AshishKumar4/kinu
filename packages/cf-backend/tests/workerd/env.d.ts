// Bindings of the workerd test worker. Deliberately separate from
// ../../env.d.ts, which declares the PRODUCTION `Env` and is compiled by
// packages/cf-backend/tsconfig.json — this directory is its own tsc project
// (see ./tsconfig.json) precisely so the two binding surfaces cannot drift into
// each other. `cloudflare:test` and `cloudflare:workers` both read
// `Cloudflare.Env`, which is why the augmentation targets that namespace and
// not the bare global `Env`.
